# breast_cancer_prediction
A very simple feedforward neural network that decides whether a given tumor is cancerous or benign based on 5 size, shape, and texture measurements as provided in the dataset, which I got from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/merishnasuwal/breast-cancer-prediction-dataset)
